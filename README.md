# Hass.io Add-on: zigbee2mqtt

Add-on for running [zigbee2mqtt](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) in [Hass.io](https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio).

## Usage

### Installation

- Add the [repository URL](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt) in your **Hass.io > Add-on Store**

The repository includes two add-ons: zigbee2mqtt and zigbee2mqtt-edge. For a stable release that tracks the released versions of zigbee2mqtt, install zigbee2mqtt. zigbee2mqtt-edge tracks the dev branch of zigbee2mqtt, so you can install the edge version if there are features or fixes in the dev branch that are not yet released.

### Configuration

To configure this add-on, you must set the following parameters via the Hass.io user interface. See the [zigbee2mqtt docs](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Running-the-bridge) and the [default configuration file](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/blob/master/data/configuration.yaml) for more information.

|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-----------|
|`data_path`|string|yes|Set this to the path you'd like the add-on to persist data. Must be within the `/share` directory. Defaults to `/share/zigbee2mqtt`.|
|`homeassistant`|bool|yes|Set this to `true` if you want MQTT autodiscovery. See [Integrating with Home Assistant](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Integrating-with-Home-Assistant) for details.|
|`permit_join`|bool|yes|Recommended to leave this to `false` and use [runtime pairing](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt#pairing). Set this to `true` when you setup new devices - make sure you set it back to `false` when done.|
|`mqtt_server`|string|yes|The MQTT server address. Make sure you include the protocol. Example: `mqtt://homeassistant`|
|`mqtt_base_topic`|string|yes|Prefix for your MQTT topic|
|`serial_port`|string|yes|Serial port for your CC2531 stick.|
|`disable_led`|bool|no|Disable the LED of your CC2531 stick.|
|`mqtt_user`|string|no|Your MQTT username, if set.|
|`mqtt_pass`|string|no|Your MQTT Password, if set.|
|`log_level`|enum|no|Set to "debug"\,"info"\,"warn"\ or "error". Defaults to \"info\". The log level for zigbee-shepherd and zigbee2mqtt. See [the wiki](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/How-to-debug) for more information.|
|`log_directory`|string|no|If set, zigbee2mqtt will store logs in this directory. The directory will be a sub-directory of the `data_path` in `/share` (set above). This option must be set to a directory (for example: `"log_directory": "logs/"` will store logs in `/share/zigbee2mqtt/logs/` by default).|
|`rtscts`|bool|no|RTS / CTS Hardware Flow Control for serial port|
|`cache_state`|bool|no|Optional state caching. See [here](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/commit/9396bde1f3b022e0f634487d1a37d2a5127c8cb3#diff-f68567477d803b49930337bf7fe1556bR16).|

Notes:
- Depending on your configuration, the MQTT server URL will need to include the port, typically `1883` or `8883` for SSL communications. For example, `mqtt://homeassistant:1883`.
- To find out which serial ports you have exposed go to **Hass.io > System > Host system > Show Hardware**

##### Modifying zigbee2mqtt's `configuration.yaml`
In some cases, you may wish to modify zigbee2mqtt's `configuration.yaml` file directly (for example, to add or modify device specific configuration](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Device-specific-configuration)). The `configuration.yaml` file used by this add-on can be modified within the data directory specified via the add-on configuration (see above). By default, therefore, the configuration file is saved to `/share/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml` on your Hass.io host. Suggested ways to edit your `configuration.yaml` file include the official [Samba share](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/samba/) add-on and the [official](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/ssh/) or [community SSH add-ons](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh).

### Pairing

The suggested way to pair your devices is to enable zigbee2mqtt's `permit_join` option from within Home Assistant using MQTT rather than through the add-on's User Interface. Below is an example configuration that will allow you to enable and disable device pairing from the Home Assistant front end:

Notes:
- There is a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ciotlosm/59d160ad49c695a801d9a940a2a387d2) with the above code
- `permit_join` will be enabled for 10 minutes (based on code automation)


### Updating the Add-on and `zigbee2mqtt` Library

The stable, versioned zigbee2mqtt can be updated using the standard Hass.io update functionality within the user interface. This add-on will be updated with bug fixes and as the underlying `zigbee2mqtt` library is updated.

To update the edge version of the add-on, you will need to uninstall and re-install the add-on. If you have reinstalled the add-on and believe that the latest version has not been installed, try removing the repository before reinstalling.

### Issues
