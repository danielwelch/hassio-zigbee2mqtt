<p>Run Zigbee2mqtt as a Hass.io Add-on</p>
</div>


## Installation

Add the repository URL via the Hassio Add-on Store Tab: `https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt`

The repository includes two add-ons: **zigbee2mqtt** and **zigbee2mqtt-edge**. For a stable release that tracks the released versions of zigbee2mqtt, install zigbee2mqtt. zigbee2mqtt-edge tracks the dev branch of zigbee2mqtt, so you can install the edge version if there are features or fixes in the dev branch that are not yet released.

## Configuration

The following table describes all available options. To run this add-on, you must set the **required** parameters via the Hass.io user interface. See the [zigbee2mqtt docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/configuration/configuration.html) and the [default configuration file](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/blob/master/data/configuration.yaml) for more information.

|Parameter|Type|Required|Description|
|---------|----|--------|-----------|
|`data_path`|string|yes|Set this to the path you'd like the add-on to persist data. Must be within the `/share` directory. Defaults to `/share/zigbee2mqtt`.|
|`homeassistant`|bool|yes|Set this to `true` if you want MQTT autodiscovery. See [Integrating with Home Assistant](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/integration/home_assistant.html) for details.|
|`permit_join`|bool|yes|Recommended to leave this to `false` and use [runtime pairing](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt#pairing). Set this to `true` when you setup new devices - make sure you set it back to `false` when done.|
|`mqtt_server`|string|yes|The MQTT server address. Make sure you include the protocol. Example: `mqtt://homeassistant`|
|`mqtt_base_topic`|string|yes|Prefix for your MQTT topic|
|`serial_port`|string|yes|Serial port for your CC2531 stick.|
|`network_key`|list(int)|yes|Specify an encryption key for your zigbee network. See [this section of the Zigbee2mqtt docs](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_secure_network.html) for more details and example usage. Leave this option empty (i.e. leave the default) if you don't want to use a network key. Note that changing this requires repairing of all device connections. Hex values are not supported, only integer values (although hex values can be used by manually editing your `configuration.yaml` file and disabling `overwrite`).|
|`devices`|list(object)|yes|See section regarding device-specific configuration below. Leave this empty if not using device-sepcific configuration.|
|`disable_led`|bool|no|Disable the LED of your CC2531 stick.|
|`mqtt_user`|string|no|Your MQTT username, if set.|
|`mqtt_pass`|string|no|Your MQTT Password, if set.|
|`include_device_information`|bool|no|Include device information to mqtt messages (default: false)|
|`reject_unauthorized`|bool|no|Disable self-signed SSL certificates|
|`log_level`|enum|no|Set to `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error`. Defaults to `info`. The log level for zigbee-shepherd and zigbee2mqtt. See [the wiki](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/how_tos/how_to_debug.html) for more information.|
|`log_directory`|string|no|If set, zigbee2mqtt will store logs in this directory. The directory will be a sub-directory of the `data_path` in `/share` (set above). This option must be set to a directory (for example: `"log_directory": "logs/"` will store logs in `/share/zigbee2mqtt/logs/` by default).|
|`pan_id`|string|no|Optional ZigBee pan ID|
|`channel`|int|no|Optional Zigbee Channel|
|`rtscts`|bool|no|RTS / CTS Hardware Flow Control for serial port|
|`cache_state`|bool|no|Optional state caching. See [here](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/commit/9396bde1f3b022e0f634487d1a37d2a5127c8cb3#diff-f68567477d803b49930337bf7fe1556bR16).|
|`soft_reset_timeout`|int|no|Soft reset ZNP after timeout (in seconds); 0 is disabled|
|`availability_timeout`|int|no|Availability timeout in seconds, disabled by default (0). When enabled, devices will be checked if they are still online.|
|`last_seen`|str|no|Add a `last_seen` attribute to MQTT messages, contains date/time of last Zigbee message. Possible values are: `disable` (default), `ISO_8601`, `epoch`|
|`elapsed`|bool|no|Add an `elapsed` attribute to MQTT messages, contains milliseconds since the previous message|
|`overwrite`|bool|no|Set this to `false` to disable overwriting any configuration defined in the zigbee2mqtt configuration YAML file when the add-on starts. Useful if you want to manually alter your `configuration.yaml` file. By default, this is set to `true`, meaning any options set in the Hass.io frontend will replace their corresponding entry in the configuration file, if present.|
|`zigbee_shepherd_debug`|bool|no|Set to `true` to enable `zigbee_shepherd` debug output in the logs/stdout.|
|`zigbee_shepherd_devices`|bool|no|If set to `true`, the add-on will look for a custom `devices.js` file within `data_path`. If this file is present, the add-on will replace the zigbee2mqtt `devices.js` file with this file. Used to experiment with and/or add support for new devices.|

- Depending on your configuration, the MQTT server URL will need to include the port, typically `1883` or `8883` for SSL communications. For example, `mqtt://homeassistant:1883`.
- To find out which serial ports you have exposed go to **Hass.io > System > Host system > Show Hardware**

#### Device-specific Configuration

Zigbee2mqtt allows certain [device-specific configuration options](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/configuration/device_specific_configuration.html). These can be configured in the add-on via the `devices` option. If you aren't using this feature, you can leave the `devices` option empty as it appears by default. See below for anexample device-specific configuration entry, adapted from the Zigbee2mqtt docs:

```json
"devices": [
  {
    "id": "0x00158d0001d82999",
    "friendly_name": "my_occupancy_sensor",
    "retain": true,
    "occupancy_timeout": 20,
    "qos": 1
  }
]
```
`temperature_precision`, `humidity_precision`, and `pressure_precision` are also supported.


#### Modifying zigbee2mqtt's `configuration.yaml`
In some cases, you may wish to modify zigbee2mqtt's `configuration.yaml` file directly (for example, to add or modify [device specific configuration](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/configuration/device_specific_configuration.html)). The `configuration.yaml` file used by this add-on can be modified within the data directory specified via the add-on configuration (see above). By default, therefore, the configuration file is saved to `/share/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml` on your Hass.io host. Suggested ways to edit your `configuration.yaml` file include the official [Samba share](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/samba/) add-on and the [official](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/ssh/) or [community SSH add-ons](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh).

- Note: Be sure to set the `overwrite` option to `false` if you want to manually modify your configuration file. Otherwise, the settings defined via the Hass.io frontend will overwrite and replace their respective fields in the configuration file on add-on startup.

### Pairing

The suggested way to pair your devices is to enable zigbee2mqtt's `permit_join` option from within Home Assistant using MQTT rather than through the add-on's User Interface. Below is an example configuration that will allow you to enable and disable device pairing from the Home Assistant front end:

<img width="503" alt="screen shot 2018-06-02 at 14 41 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7738048/40874668-bdd1645a-667a-11e8-88ff-03b78212910b.png">

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: homeassistant # This will have to be your mqtt broker
  discovery: true

input_boolean:
  zigbee_permit_join:
    name: Allow devices to join
    initial: off
    icon: mdi:cellphone-wireless

timer:
  zigbee_permit_join:
    name: Time remaining
    duration: 600 # Updated this to the number of seconds you wish

sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: Bridge state
    state_topic: "zigbee2mqtt/bridge/state"
    icon: mdi:router-wireless

automation:
  - id: enable_zigbee_join
    alias: Enable Zigbee joining
    hide_entity: true
    trigger:
      platform: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.zigbee_permit_join
      to: 'on'
    action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: zigbee2mqtt/bridge/config/permit_join
        payload: 'true'
    - service: timer.start
      data:
        entity_id: timer.zigbee_permit_join
  - id: disable_zigbee_join
    alias: Disable Zigbee joining
    trigger:
    - entity_id: input_boolean.zigbee_permit_join
      platform: state
      to: 'off'
    action:
    - data:
        payload: 'false'
        topic: zigbee2mqtt/bridge/config/permit_join
      service: mqtt.publish
    - data:
        entity_id: timer.zigbee_permit_join
      service: timer.cancel
    hide_entity: true
  - id: disable_zigbee_join_timer
    alias: Disable Zigbee joining by timer
    hide_entity: true
    trigger:
    - platform: event
      event_type: timer.finished
      event_data:
        entity_id: timer.zigbee_permit_join
    action:
    - service: mqtt.publish
      data:
        topic: zigbee2mqtt/bridge/config/permit_join
        payload: 'false'
    - service: input_boolean.turn_off
      data:
        entity_id: input_boolean.zigbee_permit_join
```
And add something like the following to your lovelace YAML file (if using YAML mode):
```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: input_boolean.zigbee_permit_join
  - entity: timer.zigbee_permit_join
  - entity: sensor.bridge_state
show_header_toggle: false
title: Zigbee
```


Notes:
- `permit_join` will be enabled for 10 minutes (based on code automation)

### Updating the Add-on and `zigbee2mqtt` Library

The stable, versioned zigbee2mqtt can be updated using the standard Hass.io update functionality within the user interface. This add-on will be updated with bug fixes and as the underlying `zigbee2mqtt` library is updated.

To update the edge version of the add-on, you will need to uninstall and re-install the add-on. If you have reinstalled the add-on and believe that the latest version has not been installed, try removing the repository before reinstalling.
