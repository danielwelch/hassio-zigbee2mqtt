# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

This project is versioned based upon the version of [zigbee2mqtt](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt). The versioning `X.Y.Z` of the stable release of this add-on will track that of zigbee2mqtt. If there are new releases without upgrades to the zigbee2mqtt version (i.e., changes to the add-on that occur between releases of zigbee2mqtt), an additional number will be added to indicate this (`X.Y.Z.A`, where `A` indicates a new versioned release).

## 1.10.1 - 2020-02-?
### Added
- Added config options `network_key_string` and `ext_pan_id_string`.

## 1.10.0 - 2019-02-06
### Changed
- Upgrade zigbe22mqtt to 1.10.0

## 1.9.0 - 2019-01-17
### Added
- Added config option `zigbee_herdsman_debug`. Zigbee2mqtt moved from the old `zigbee_shepherd` library to the `zigbee_herdsman` library some time ago, so this option was added to reflect the change and keep things consistent. The old `zigbee_shepherd_debug` option is still supported, and setting either to `true` will enable `zigbee_shepherd` DEBUG mode. 
### Changed
- Upgrade zigbee2mqtt to 1.9.0

## 1.8.0 - 2019-12-16
### Changed

- BREAKING: 
- Upgrade zigbee2mqtt to 1.7.0
  - There are breaking changes when upgrading to zigbee2mqtt 1.7 with respect to the user's underlying zigbee device database used by zigbee2mqtt. You cannot roll back to 1.6 after updating without repairing all your devices (the device database used by zigbee2mqtt 1.7 is not backwards compatible for older versions)

### Changed
- Switch the edge and non-edge dockerfiles so they're actually correct. Sigh. This is why you don't write code after 28 hour shifts.
- Download release archives instead of git cloning the specific branch
- Upgrade to version 0.1.1 of `zigbee2mqtt`

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2018-07-16
### Changed
Version 0.1.0 is the first versioned release of the add-on. The repository actually establishes two add-ons:
- `zigbee2mqtt` add-on, which will use the first released version of the `zigbee2mqtt` library and will update as new versions of that library are released
- `zigbee2mqtt-edge` add-on, which will build with the latest commit to the `zigbee2mqtt` master branch. Each update to the library will trigger a new add-on image to be built. In effect, this add-on will function the same way that the pre-release version of this add-on did.
